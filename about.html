    <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h2>
    <h4>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My name is Serena Roderick and I am a 24 year old living in Brookline, Massachusetts. I graduated Northeastern University in December of 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Graphic Design. Now I am looking to start my career doing interface design and software development. I have always had a deep fascination with technology due to its seemingly limitless capabilities and contributions to the advancement and betterment of humanity. Being able to make an impact in this field excites me and I am eager to join a company that will allow me to do so.
